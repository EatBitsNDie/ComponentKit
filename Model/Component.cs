/// ###TL;DR..
/// 
/// The `Component` is used to build custom behavior.

/// ####Processing
/// 
/// Triggers can be used to intercept when components are attached/dettached from entities, 
/// which makes it easy to add special processing of specific types of components.
/// 
/// ####Staying n'sync
/// 
/// A component becomes out-of-sync when it is no longer attached to an `IEntityRecord`. Triggers, however, 
/// are not guaranteed to be notified of this immediately. The default implementation of `IEntityRecordCollection` 
/// only runs the triggers during a synchronization operation.
