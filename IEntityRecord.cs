/// ###TL;DR..
/// 
/// Throughout these documents, an `IEntityRecord` will be referred to as an *entity*. You can visualize it as a **row** in a database table, where each **column** holds a **component**. 

/// ####Similarities and differences
/// 
/// Just like in a regular database, it's not possible to have 2 identical rows. And, in most implementations, it's not possible to attach more 
/// than one column/component of the same type to a single entity - though I guess that actually makes it quite dissimilar.
/// 
/// But, since the components are just instances of real classes, they're not limited to being specific datatypes, and instead of simply 
/// providing data, they can have behavior too.
